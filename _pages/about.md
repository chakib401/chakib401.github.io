I am an industrial PhD student (CIFRE) at the 
<a href='https://centreborelli.ens-paris-saclay.fr/en'>Centre Borelli </a> at UniversitÃ© Paris CitÃ©, and <a href="https://www.icdc.caissedesdepots.fr/"> Informatique Caisse des DÃ©pÃ´ts</a> in Paris, France. 

[//]: # (I grew up in Algiers, Algeria ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡¿.)



I am broadly interested in unsupervised learning with a focus on representation learning and clustering. 
Most work I have done dealt with graphs and textual data.

In addition to research, I do some general data science work as well as some web development in the industry.
