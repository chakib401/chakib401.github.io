I have recently been recruited as a Technical Lead in machine learning at Informatique Caisse des Dépôts.

Before that I did a PhD at the Centre Borelli at the University of Paris Cité and Informatique Caisse des Dépôts in Paris, France. My research primarily focused on unsupervised learning techniques for handling graph data at scale. Another interest of mine was exploring the use of **optimal transport** for solving **machine learning** problems.
