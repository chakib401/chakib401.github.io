I am a PhD student (CIFRE) at the 
<a href='https://centreborelli.ens-paris-saclay.fr/en'>Centre Borelli </a> at UniversitÃ© Paris CitÃ©, and <a href="https://www.icdc.caissedesdepots.fr/"> Informatique Caisse des DÃ©pÃ´ts</a> in Paris, France. 

[//]: # (I grew up in Algiers, Algeria ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡¿.)



I am mostly interested in **unsupervised** methods for dealing with **graph data** in a **scalable** manner. Another interest of mine is exploring the use of **optimal transport** in general **machine learning** problems.

In addition to research, I did some general data science work as well as some web development in the industry.
